From the get-go, when we were deciding who we wanted to be our videographer for our special day... I absolutely fell in love with Justin's style. His camera angles, the way he uses light, the clarity, ALL OF IT is just jaw-dropping. Without even knowing him, I would comment on his Instagram just raving over complete strangers' weddings and fan-girling over his gifts and abilities. I just KNEW that he was going to capture the beauty of our wedding day in a way that I could only see in my dreams. Not only are Justin and Emma extraordinary talents, but they are extraordinary humans. They invested themselves into getting to know me, my husband, and us as a couple. We shared stories about our fur babies/children and exchanged smiles, patience, flexibility and joy all day long. They kept us laughing, made us feel comfortable, and were just a complete dream to work with. I could go on and on and on but I truly think I would break my computer. This may seem so weird... but I LOVE and truly care about Justin and Emma as if I've known them forever. The best, most kind people ever. I cannot wait to see how they captured our special and unforgettable day!!!","name":"Emma Law","shortened_text":"I still get emotional anytime I think about Justin and Emma and their role in our wedding day. . .They kept us laughing, made us feel comfortable, and were just a complete dream to work with."}},{"id":"362","title":"Emma Law","slug":"test-1-4","template":"","prev":"NA","next":"NA","categories":"NA","tags":"NA","yoast_head":"N","modified":"2022-04-27T14:47:30Z","acf":{"text":"Justin's team created the most incredible film for our wedding that took place on Sea Island in October of 2021 and every second was absolutely breathtaking. My husband and I cannot recommend Justin Peay Productions enough. Having their team (shout out to Ryan and Lindsey) on-site for our wedding felt so natural that we almost forgot they were there, which makes for the best and most natural footage.\r\n\r\nEach of our friends and family members cried tears of joy at the heartfelt film and were so impressed by the stunning shots. I would highly recommend doing the drone footage because it was incredible and gave a full sense of not only the setting of our wedding, but the entire island on our wedding day.\r\n\r\nMy husband and I, along with our families, could not be more grateful for such an unforgettable film. We will cherish this footage for the rest of our lives. If you're thinking about booking with Justin's team, do it, you will not be disappointed.\r\n","name":"Emma Law","shortened_text":"Justin's team created the most incredible film for our wedding. . . every second was absolutely breathtaking."}},{"id":"375","title":"Madison Gardner","slug":"madison-gardner","template":"","prev":"NA","next":"NA","categories":"NA","tags":"NA","yoast_head":"N","modified":"2022-04-27T14:51:34Z","acf":{"text":"Such an awesome videographer!

As a wedding photographer, sometimes it can be hard to navigate both teams with the same goal and not get in each other's way. Justin and his assistant took the time with me to block out locations prior to the ceremony, being respectful of each other's camera locations and focal lengths. He also ran to retrieve a forgotten bouquet during portrait sessions and had some great posing prompts during the couple's session. We worked seamlessly together, and I cannot vouch for his talent, professionalism and personality enough. I'll be recommending him to ALL my couples!\r\n","shortened_text":"We worked seamlessly together, and I cannot vouch for his talent, professionalism and personality enough.
